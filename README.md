# yeoman interactions

when working with requirements for example using appname
we run 
`yo yang my-cool-app`


when working with options
`yo yang my-cool-app --includeutils`


Yeoman prompts are based on Inquierer.js. So this is a good place to get more ideas how promps can work.

Make sure to run at times `npm link`. I noticed at one point creating a generated project didn't work all the way.
